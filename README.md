# Heart-Disease-Prediction

his project focuses on developing a machine learning model using Logistic Regression for accurate prediction of heart disease based on a diverse set of patient parameters. The dataset used in this project consists of several essential features, including age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol levels (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak), slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope), number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca), thalassemia type (thal), and the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

The project follows a comprehensive pipeline that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. During the data preprocessing phase, the dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and categorical variables are appropriately encoded. Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the relationships between variables and identify potential patterns. Feature selection techniques are employed to identify the most informative attributes for the prediction task, optimizing the model's performance and reducing dimensionality.

The Machine Learning Algorithm that I used is Logistic Regression. 

The trained Logistic Regression model can be used to predict the likelihood of heart disease for new patients, assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and providing timely interventions.
